/**
 * Run the seam suites without letting the first red hide the second, and hold the set of reds to
 * the declared ledger.
 *
 * Two separate jobs, in this order:
 *   1. print everything. Each suite is spawned, its verdict line, every `not ok:` / `✖` name and
 *      every `SKIP:` line is printed verbatim, and the count of red suites is reported. Nothing here
 *      suppresses a failure: the deliberate reds of #46 are evidence and they stay printed.
 *   2. gate on the SET, not on the pass/fail of the suites. `tests/deliberate-reds.mjs` declares
 *      which assertions are red on which machine shape (win32 = the maintainer machine, posix = the
 *      ubuntu runner). The runner exits 0 only when the observed set equals the declared set for this
 *      shape. So a new regression turns the frame red, and so does a red that quietly went green —
 *      which is the failure mode a permanently-red branch would have hidden.
 *
 * Why not just let the suites decide the verdict: because #46 ships five assertions that must fail
 * until issue #44 §6 is repaired, and this project's accepted surface is "cloud checks green". A red
 * frame that is expected is a frame that cannot warn. Moving the gate to the ledger keeps the reds
 * AND keeps the warning.
 *
 *   node scripts/run-seams.mjs              # verdict + ledger check
 *   node scripts/run-seams.mjs --legacy     # old behaviour: exit with the count of red suites
