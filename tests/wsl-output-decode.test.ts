/**
 * wsl.exe output decoding, offline.
 *
 * `src/shared/wsl.ts:102` picks UTF-16LE by probing the captured buffer for a NUL byte.
 * Before this file the branch had no offline assertion at all — `grep -rn utf16 tests/`
 * found exactly one hit, `tests/exec-shape.mjs:42`, which needs a live distribution and a
 * win32 host. Every W1 check that decodes registry or wsl.exe output depends on this sniff,
 * so it is tested with synthetic buffers and a faked child_process: nothing here spawns
 * wsl.exe, which is what makes it runnable on the ubuntu runner.
 *
 *   node --test --experimental-strip-types tests/wsl-output-decode.test.ts
